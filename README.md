# STM Dashboard

## Introduction

This repository includes some experimental work on the visualization of space-time matrix (STM) datasets.

## Repository structure

* [`stm-dashboard`](./stm-dashboard): A minimal dashboard implementation based on panel to visualize an example STM 
  dataset.
* [`notebooks`](./notebooks):
  * [`stm-and-contextual-data.ipynb`](./notebooks/stm-and-contextual-data.ipynb): Visualize an STM dataset together with 
    some contextual data (space- and time-dependent). 

## Installation

Create the Python environment using `conda` (or its faster implementation `mamba`):

```shell
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
